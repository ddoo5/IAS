# What is that?
That's console application which can create indexed database with your words.        
It can count all words, but after indexing.        
It can search any word you want to search and very fast(if you have indexed database)           

# How to use?
You download code or release(add link) and launch. Than you enter path to dictionary and choose options. Dictionary must be only in ```.txt``` type and the dictionary should be without special symbols. For example, you can check [```data.txt```](https://github.com/ddoo5/IAS/blob/main/data.txt). In result you will get, if you choose indexing, indexed [```database.db```](https://github.com/ddoo5/IAS/blob/main/test.db)
